/*! \page g711_page A-law and mu-law handling
Lookup tables for A-law and u-law look attractive, until you consider the impact
on the CPU cache. If it causes a substantial area of your processor cache to get
hit too often, cache sloshing will severely slow things down. The main reason
these routines are slow in C, is the lack of direct access to the CPU's "find
the first 1" instruction. A little in-line assembler fixes that, and the
conversion routines can be faster than lookup tables, in most real world usage.
A "find the first 1" instruction is available on most modern CPUs, and is a
much underused feature.

If an assembly language method of bit searching is not available, these routines
revert to a method that can be a little slow, so the cache thrashing might not
seem so bad :(

Feel free to submit patches to add fast "find the first 1" support for your own
favourite processor.

Look up tables are used for transcoding between A-law and u-law, since it is
difficult to achieve the precise transcoding procedure laid down in the G.711
specification by other means.
